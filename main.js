The participants included a number of people who would later be key leaders of GEN — Max Lindegger, Declan Kennedy, and Albert Bates—as well as intellectuals outside of the ecovillage sphere, such as Karl-Henrik Robert, founder of The Natural Step , David Korten (who later wrote When Corporations Rule the World) and Marilyn Mehlmann of The Global Action Plan. The consensus that the group reached was that Gaia Trust should support the people who were actually living the new paradigm— ecovillagers, because they were essential for the transition, but were receiving no support from elsewhere. It became clear to all that the world needed good examples of what it means to live in harmony with nature in a sustainable and spiritually-satisfying way in a technologically advanced society."

Gaia Trust committed to covering the expenses of the network for 3-5 years. The plan was to focus initially on forming regional networks that would link existing projects. At the same time a second longer-term goal was set to create global services, like an education network, that would cut across regions, as soon as budgets and manpower permitted."

A model windmill, solar cells and running water contributed to a pleasant atmosphere. Hildur had prepared a booklet in 5000 copies called The Earth is Our Habitat. More than 40 workshops covering all issues of ecovillages and global politics were held. Outside, GEN was in charge of building an old Harran stone house with master builders from the region."

But he tragically suffered a debilitating stroke during his first speech, was unconscious for four months, slowly recovered all faculties but passed away in early 2004.

For all intents and purposes, GEN had become a volunteer organization.<br><br>After the cutback in 2003, GEN continued to develop slowly over the next six years or so. These were difficult years. A positive aspect was the annual GEN-Europe assembly, which attracted more and more people each year, as the ecovillage idea gradually spread, not least to Eastern Europe and Russia. With the introduction of the Gaia Education program in 2005, new life emerged in many ecovillages, as education was seen not only as a vehicle for local outreach but also for generating some income. The free material and a polished curriculum with UNITAR and UNESCO's stamp of approval made it easy to get started and attract people. Education was becoming an essential part of every ecovillage's story."

One of the major goals of this time was to support the emergence of an independent African network which was initiated in 2012, with financial help, once again, from the German foreign ministry, which followed developments with great interest. <br><br>A new generation of GEN was very creative in extending its range of activities, while inspiring increasing momentum in all regions. A more streamlined organization and broader vision was established. In 2013, an independent South American network—CASA—evolved out of ENA. The youth organization, NextGEN, flourished."

Nelson enrolled in our course but was not taking notes or understanding the material. The National Police also assigned a Lt. Hernandez and in contrast, he was very studious because Chief of Police Reyes has instructed him to teach everything he learned after the course. When we did a cob dance with the C.O. and the Lt., their M-16s leaning against coconut palms, out there stomping and tossing cobs, there were several hundred schoolkids gawking, pointing and giggling at the officers getting all muddy."}},

The FARC controlled the surrounding mountains and killed 60 civilians in roadblocks that month we were there. We gave a permaculture fundamentals course to the Kuna people who manage Panama’s World Biodiversity Reserve and are abused by all sides of the civil war. We instructed refugees fleeing La Violencia how to construct natural homes of earthbags, cob and strawbale better suited to the local conditions than the plastic tent shelters they were being provided by aid agencies. We taught them the principles of permaculture. The Mayor of Unguia, who invited us into the camps, was assassinated by either FARC or landowner paramilitaries the week after we left. We had some narrow escapes ourselves but were protected at night by Tenete Nelson whose Colombian Defense Force camped close to us. I wrote this story for Grist magazine in December 2000."}},

After extensive investigation, la Caravana chose Azuay as the most appropriate province for hosting the Women’s Peace Village. \n<br>\nFrom February to May of 2002, a total of forty women leaders selected by RSMEF and Tejemujeres members participated in ENA workshops in: <br>\n<br>- Administrative Skills\n<br>- Event Planning\n<br>- Consensus Decision-Making / Meeting Facilitation / Conflict Resolution\n<br>- Video Documentation. \n<br><br>\nThree trainers were from the U.S. (Consensus Decision-Making, Meeting Facilitation and Video Documentation). Another trainer for Video Documentation was brought from Mexico, and international trainers aboard la Caravana brought diversity to the group from Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia. Most of the trainers were women, all were Spanish speakers, and they came from diverse social, geographic, economic and cultural backgrounds. Training and resource materials were translated into Spanish as needed and were provided for all participants. Child care was provided.The two-month Peace Village brought 140 women leaders from all parts of Ecuador and included women from 109 Ecuadorian women’s organizations and 16 provinces, reflecting an extraordinary geographical and cultural diversity. \n<br><br>\nOne product was the production of a database detailing more than 280 women’s groups, which was put on CD-ROM and made available to the women’s organizations. It is to our knowledge the only relatively complete listing of women’s organizations in Ecuador and as such represented an important step in the unification of the women’s leadership movement, which for three months coalesced around the concept of ecovillage design and development in both urban and rural contexts. \n<br><br>\nhttp://www.i4at.org/peacevillage/FINALREPORTWPV.html"}},
